### Fisher's Iris Data set History

The *Iris* *flower* *data*, also known as *Fisher's* *Iris* *data* *set* was introduced by British biologist and statistician Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher in his 1936 article titled "[*The* *Use* *of* *Multiple* *Measurements* *in* *Taxonomic* *Problems*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x)". It is important to mention that the data used in aforementioned article were not collect directly by Fisher himself but by Dr. Edgar Anderson, who collected it in the Gaspé Peninsula region of Canada. The article Fisher formulated and assessed a linear function that distinguishes between Iris species based on the morphology of their flowers.[^1]

Iris flowers can be distinguished in **three** species:*Iris* *Setosa*, *Iris* *Virginica* & *Iris* *Versicolor* as shown in the image below[^2]:
