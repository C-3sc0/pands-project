## Fisher's Iris Data set information

### Fisher's Iris Data set History

The *Iris* *flower* *data*, also known as *Fisher's* *Iris* *data* *set* was introduced by British biologist and statistician Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher in his 1936 article titled "[*The* *Use* *of* *Multiple* *Measurements* *in* *Taxonomic* *Problems*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x)". It is important to mention that the data used in aforementioned article were not collect directly by Fisher himself but by Dr. Edgar Anderson, who collected it in the Gaspé Peninsula region of Canada. 
The article Fisher formulated and assessed a linear function that distinguishes between Iris species based on the morphology of their flowers.[^1]

Iris flowers can be distinguished in **three** species:*Iris* *Setosa*, *Iris* *Virginica* & *Iris* *Versicolor* as shown in the image below[^2]:

## Data set code and Analysis

### Fisher's Iris Data set file

The Iris data set, commonly used in the pattern recognition and machine learning field, consist of 50 samples for the 3 classes of iris flowers. Where one class of plants can be separated from the other two classes through a linear boundary, while the other two classes cannot be separated from each other using a linear boundary[^3]. 

### Data Dimension

The Iris Data set constist of 150 instances, each having five attribue:

 1. *Sepal* *length* in cm
 2. *Sepal* *width* in cm
 3. *Petal* *length* in cm
 4. *Petal* *width* in cm
 5. *Class* 

The first 4 attributes are considered quantitative variables, whereas the last one is cosidered categorical variable representing the species of the flower. This variable can take on three possible values: *Setosa*, *Virginica* and *Versicolour* [^4].
